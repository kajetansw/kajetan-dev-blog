Passion – that’s the answer for question above. I’m done here, thank you 😉

All my life I’ve bee chasing something that would give me huge **satisfaction**. Like always, some trials ended with failures (my first collage choice), other were pretty successful (writing my own novel).

Two years ago I started making my first steps in programming and IT. Finally I completely lost my self in it and after some trials and errors I made it! I found my first job as Graduate Developer!

You may be wondering: “What’s so special about it? Why should I even care?”

And I will gladly answer that issue: I have no bloody idea 😉

Hi, I’m Kajetan and my story isn’t really different from any other story you hear about people just starting in IT. Five months ago I’ve begun graduate programme in a company making solutions for financial sector (insurances, accounting, etc.). After three months of internship I’ve been called for a review and got to know, that the company is interested in further work with me and want to keep me as Junior Developer. Of course I gladly accepted the offer and since that I’ve been excited with my job, project and team I work with!

Enough with my professional life for now, let’s continue with motivation. For past two years I’m interested with IT and I must say, that there’s something remarkable about it. Something, that keeps fascinate and motivate me to further unravel secrets of IT.

It is **unlimited possibilities of growth**.

Technologies evolve every day and programmer has possibility to study in every direction he/she wants. **Study materials are available everywhere** – every technology has its documentation, creators deliver tutorials, there are discussion boards, articles, etc. If someone doesn’t mind – there are also paid tutorials and courses out there. You can also try to learn for yourself, it’s just as fun! You just need to want it.

I think of myself as enthusiast of **learning itself**. I enjoy the process, that satisfaction that you get after many weeks, months, even years, when you look back on how you started and where you are now. During this process I always **write notes**. I often get back to them when I create my side project or just work. I always want them to be in order and close at hand.

Not long ago I came across the thought – why not enhance this process further? I came into conclusion, that blog would be good solution for that. By creating posts about what I have learned I would not only **order my knowledge** but it also **share it with others**. Who knows, maybe it will inspire others who would want to share their knowledge and experiences.

With that, I would like to start my **little experiment**. Since now I will collect my knowledge and experiences here – in smaller and larger doses.

(I do not think of myself an expert in any discipline that I will mention here further on. So please be patient with me 😉 People learn every day, don’t they?)
