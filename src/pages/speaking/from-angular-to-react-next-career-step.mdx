There's a time in every developer's career when they ask themselves a question - "What's the next big thing for me?". There are a lot of reasons for it. We do that to improve our skills, our paychecks, to start doing things that we care about.

Recently I asked this question myself and decided to gain a new perspective as a web developer - to learn the next major technology there is. After two years of working in Angular, I decided to switch to React.

This talk sums up the reasons behind this change and what's my opinion about those two web giants after six months after the change.
