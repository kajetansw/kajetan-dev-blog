SolidJS has brought a lot of attention lately in the web world. It makes a solid (pun intended) competition to the most popular web frameworks, and not without a reason. 
But I won’t spoil it for you, you have to see for yourself!

This talk serves as a gentle introduction to SolidJS. During the event, you’ll hear about basic concepts behind the framework and what makes it stand out - all based on a real-world 
example of a small feature that’ll be live-coded in front of you.
