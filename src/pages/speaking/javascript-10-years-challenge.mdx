My first professional talk (ever!) done as a part of Community of Practice (CoP) meetups at my company.

For the past two years we are progressing towards migrating our products to the newest Angular framework. As I was a part of the team that did the migration first, I wanted to share my insight with other teams. I gave a talk on what exactly is JavaScript and how cool it is that we are starting adopting it!
