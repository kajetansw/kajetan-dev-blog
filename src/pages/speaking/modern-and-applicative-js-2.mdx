This was a second part of workshops I hosted where we worked on implementing "Splitter" web application together. 

I took this opportunity to introduce TypeScript and talk about why it can make our lives easier. Then we migrated our existing REST API implementation to TypeScript as a part of the step-by-step live coding session.
