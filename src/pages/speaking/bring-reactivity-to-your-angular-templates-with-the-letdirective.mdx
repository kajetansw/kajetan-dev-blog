This is a 100% live coding session when we jumped straight to code editors and implemented our ow Angular structural 
directive for binding RxJS Observables to the template and viewing different templates for each of the Observable notifications.

This talk is heavily inspired by a two-part article of mine under the same name published on [indepth.dev](https://indepth.dev)
