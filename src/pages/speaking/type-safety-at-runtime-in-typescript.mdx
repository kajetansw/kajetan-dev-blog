We all know, that TypeScript helps us in many ways. The compiler guides us during our work, ensuring, that every piece of data falls into a given place. 

But there are some limitations. TypeScript was meant to help us during development time. After the compilation step, we still cannot be 100% sure what can happen during runtime... Unless we do something about that and defend ourselves against unwanted runtime errors! 

This talk serves as an introduction to the problem and explains how we can face it to make our applications more error-proof.

This is a v2 version of the [Type-safety at runtime with JSON decoders](/speaking/type-safety-at-runtime/) talk I did.
