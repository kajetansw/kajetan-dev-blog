As we all know, TypeScript’s adds static typing and compile-time type checking to our beloved JavaScript. But wait… What about runtime? How do I know, that my application still gets valid data from the external REST API?

Don’t worry, JSON decoders come to the rescue!

During this talk, all participants got a brief introduction to the concept of JSON decoders and how to use them in TypeScript.
