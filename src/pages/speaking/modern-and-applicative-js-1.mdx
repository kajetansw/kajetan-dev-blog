After a really broad introduction to JavaScript as a language with a lot of theory and facts I decided that it was a time to jump into practice!

The goal was to build foundations for a modern web application using various JavaScript technologies. The theme was to create a "Splitter" application. It is a  clone of [Splitwiseⓒ](https://www.splitwise.com/) - application for splitting expenses with other users.

During these workshops all participants had an opportunity to learn modern ES2015+ standards of JavaScript by building REST API with NodeJS and [express.js](https://expressjs.com/).
