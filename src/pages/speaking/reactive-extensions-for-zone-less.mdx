Angular's change detection relies heavily on the Zone.js. Zone wraps asynchronous tasks happening in our Angular 
applications and triggers change detection almost "automagically".

Most of the time it's a great reliever for every Angular developer: we don't have to worry about triggering change detection 
ourselves - the framework does it for us. Although the Angular team did a great job of optimizing this solution, we subconsciously 
know that to every solution there are always some caveats. This is sadly not an exception.

This talk presents a few problems we have to face when dealing with Zone.js and change detection and what are the conditions that
lead to those. A solution for those problems is also presented: those that come straight from the core Angular and those provided
by external libraries.
