This was a third (and last 😔) part of workshops I hosted at my company where we worked on implementing "Splitter" web application together.

This time we got into the core of the entire workshop series - implementing front-end of our app in Angular! 

Sadly this was the end but I was enormously excited to share and almost... "advocate" for this technologies, libraries and frameworks in front of my co-workers from other teams. I hope they left the workshops excited about what's to come as I was happy creating this content 😊
