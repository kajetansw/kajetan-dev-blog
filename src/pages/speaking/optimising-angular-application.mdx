Talk I gave as a part of Community of Practice (CoP) meetup at my company.

I won't hide the fact - I was extremely inspired by a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybNj-id0kjY) given by [Minko Gechev](https://twitter.com/mgechev) on optimizing Angular applications during ngConf. It was one of the best Angular-related talks of 2019 - no doubts. 

I even noticed a trend that started developing in the community (I saw it mostly on Twitter) about this topic. Almost every week there was a new article/video/tutorial about it!

So... Being totally influenced by the crowd I decided to give my own take on the topic! 😏 Also, I was happy that we've already completed by "intro to JS and Angular" workshop series - me and my colleagues from the office were more than ready to talk about more... "mature" stuff 😊
